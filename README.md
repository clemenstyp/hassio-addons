# Hass.io Add-Ons

* [Homebridge](https://github.com/olivierguerriat/hassio-addons/tree/master/homebridge) (WIP, does not work yet)

## Installation

[Follow the official instructions](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons/) and use the following URL:

## Acknowledgments

The build script and Travis config come straight from [bestlibre's repository](https://github.com/bestlibre/hassio-addons), thank you!

(but my Dockerfile makes Travis hang, for some reasons)
